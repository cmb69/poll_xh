<h1>Poll_XH - a CMSimple_XH Plugin</h1>
<img src="../poll.png" style="display:block; float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0">
<p style="text-align:justify">Poll_XH facilitates to place polls on your CMSimple_XH website.
You can have as many polls you like, with as many options you like (single or multiple choice).
The voters are distinguished by cookie and IP address, so cheating is somewhat unlikely.</p>

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>You can embed a poll on a CMSimple page with the following plugin call:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:poll('name-of-the-poll');}}}</pre>
<p>To embed a poll in the template use:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php echo poll('name-of-the-poll');?&gt;</pre>
<p>Instead of 'name-of-the-poll' you can use any name as long as it consists
of lowercase letters (a-z), digits (0-9) and hyphens only.
You can embed as many polls on any single page as you like &ndash;
they're working independent of each other as long as they have different names.</p>
<p>If the poll has not ended and the visitor has not voted yet,
he will be presented the voting view and can submit his vote.
After he has voted, he can see the results of the poll.</p>
<p>Currently the poll data files have to be created and edited manually.
Just put a file name-of-the-poll.csv to Poll_XH's data folder (plugins/poll/data/ by default).
Each voting option has it's own line in the file.
Additionally there are two meta options, namely %%%MAX%%% and %%%END%%%,
which you have to put in separate lines too. Both are optional.<p>
<pre>%%%MAX%%%&rarr;3</pre>
<p>will make a multiple-choice poll where the user can check 3 options at most, and with</p>
<pre>%%%END%%%&rarr;1335744000</pre>
<p>you can specify the end date of the poll as UNIX timestamp.
Note that the &rarr; stands for a &lt;tab&gt; character.
To calculate the UNIX timestamp of a date, you can use an
<a href="http://www.onlineconversion.com/unix_time.htm">online converter</a>.</p>
<p>As an example a cmsimple.csv file is delivered, which should explain the file format.
The end date of this poll is set to December, 31st 2012.
You can embed this poll on a page by writing:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:poll('cmsimple');}}}</pre>
