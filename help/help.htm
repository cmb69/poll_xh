<p>
    Poll_XH facilitates to place polls on your CMSimple_XH website. You can have
    as many polls you like, with as many options you like (single or multiple
    choice). The voters are distinguished by cookie and IP address, so cheating
    is somewhat unlikely.

<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    You can embed a poll on a CMSimple_XH page with the following plugin call:
</p>
<pre>{{{poll('name-of-the-poll')}}}</pre>
<p>
    To embed a poll in the template use:
</p>
<pre>&lt;?=poll('name-of-the-poll')?&gt;</pre>
<p>
    Instead of <code>name-of-the-poll</code> you can use any name as long as it
    consists of lowercase letters (<code>a</code>-<code>z</code>), digits
    (<code>0</code>-<code>9</code>) and hyphens only. You can embed as many
    polls on any single page as you like – they're working independent of each
    other as long as they have different names.
</p>
<p>
    If the poll has not ended and the visitor has not voted yet, they will be
    presented the voting view and can submit their vote. After they have voted,
    they can see the results of the poll.
</p>
<p>
    Currently the poll data files have to be created and edited manually. Just
    put a file <code>name-of-the-poll.csv</code> into the subfolder
    <code>poll/</code> of CMSimple_XH's <code>content/</code> folder. Each
    voting option has it's own line in the file. Additionally there are two meta
    options, namely <code>%%%MAX%%%</code> and <code>%%%END%%%</code>, which you
    have to put in separate lines too. Both are optional.
<p>
<pre>%%%MAX%%%&rarr;3</pre>
<p>
    will make a multiple-choice poll where the user can check 3 options at most,
    and with
</p>
<pre>%%%END%%%&rarr;1335744000</pre>
<p>
    you can specify the end date of the poll as UNIX timestamp. Note that the
    <code>&rarr;</code> stands for a <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> character. To
    calculate the UNIX timestamp of a date, you can use an <a
    href="http://www.onlineconversion.com/unix_time.htm">online converter</a>.
</p>
<p>
    As an example a <code>fifa-2018.csv</code> file is delivered in the
    <code>help/</code> folder, which is supposed to explain the file format. The
    end date of this poll is set to the beginning of the 2018 FIFA World Cup
    Russia (which is June, 14th 2018). After moving the file to
    <code>content/poll/</code>, you can embed this poll on a page by writing:
</p>
<pre>{{{poll('fifa-2018')}}}</pre>
</section>

<section id="limitations">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
    Resetting an already running poll is not possible, because respective
    cookies may already been stored on the computer of a voter, so they could
    not vote again. As workaround you would have to rename the poll.
</p>
<p>
    32bit versions of PHP can't handle Unix timestamps larger than 2147483647
    (which is January, 19th 2038). Therefore, with such versions it is not
    possible to end polls after that date.
